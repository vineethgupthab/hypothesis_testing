What is Hypothesis Testing?
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses - the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1) - and using sample data to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis.

Steps in Hypothesis Testing:

DEAD

- Defining Hypothesis
- Experimentation/Collecting the data
- Analyzing through statistical testing
- Drawing conclusion
